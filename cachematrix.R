## Matrix inverse computation is a costly operation and 
## there is some benefit to caching already computed values
## rather than computing repeatedly. The following has a pair
## of functions that calculates and caches the inverse of a martix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y){
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(i) inv <<- i
  getinv <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get, setinv = setinv, getinv = getinv)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the 
## inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  inv <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(inv)){
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  
  inv <- solve(x$get(), ...)
  x$setinv(inv)
  return(inv)
}
